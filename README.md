Hello, I'm Shinra

Mostly here because I have an appreciation for OpenSource software,
as well as those providing and maintaining it.
I'll probably post some projects on here if I consider them 
interesting or useful enough, to give back to said community.

I know a couple languages but my favourite is probably C#,
although Rust and Java are up there too.

My least favourite - from what I know - is PHP,
not a big fan of web development anyway.
And if I did, I could use ASP.NET or target
WebAssembly with Rust :)
