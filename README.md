Hello, I'm Shinra

Mostly here because I have an appreciation for OpenSource software,
as well as those providing and maintaining it.
I'll probably post some projects on here if I consider them 
interesting or useful enough, to give back to said community.

I know a couple languages but my favourites are C# and C++.
Also, I have an irrational fear of WinForms :)
